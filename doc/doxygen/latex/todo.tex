Class \hyperlink{classderegnet_1_1DeregnetFinder}{deregnet\+:\+:Deregnet\+Finder$<$ Model\+Type, Data $>$} ]This desgin seems not very optimal and somehow flawed. The most straight-\/forward improvment would be to implement the absolute version of the algorithm, i.\+e. Model\+Type = G\+R\+B\+Model, in terms of grbfrc\+::\+F\+M\+I\+LP. Model\+Type would go away and Data could specfiy which algorithm to run, for example.

More refined logging system.
